## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is my second project with SASS. Curently am not using anuthing from fancy SASS possibilities :D, just nesting properties for start while I dont feel confident enough to implement other stuff.

I used include-media Sass library for writing CSS media queries in an easy and maintainable way, using a natural and simplistic syntax. Iclude media Sass library is writen by [Eduardo Bou√ßas](https://github.com/eduardoboucas) and you can find out more at [Include media](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media)
